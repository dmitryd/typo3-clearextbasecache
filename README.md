# TYPO3 CMS 'clearextbasecache' extension

This extension will clear Extbase cache when the developer adds a new property to the Extbase class.

Typically you need to clear these caches when you see an exception that a certain property does not exist after you added it.

Install and use the cache menu as usual.
